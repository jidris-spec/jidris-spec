## 📂 Projects

💊 Digital Health Record Application

Tech Stack: React, MUI, React Router
A patient–doctor–admin platform that simulates a real digital health workflow with lifecycle-driven data, progress tracking, and multi-role dashboards.

Core Features

🧑‍⚕️ Patient & Doctor Authentication
Separate login flows for patients, doctors, and admin.

📝 Patient Case Submission
Patients submit their symptoms, upload documents, and track treatment progress.

🔍 Doctor Workspace
Doctors view assigned patients, review cases, update progress, and upload medical reports.

📊 Dashboard with Healthcare KPIs
KPI cards for Patients, Appointments, and Lab Results — with skeleton loaders for micro-interactions.

🗂️ Case Lifecycle Management
open → in_review → closed, with automatic activity logs across the system.

📤 Document Uploads
Both patients and doctors can upload PDFs and view attachments.

🕒 Recent Activity Feed
Automatically logs everything: new cases, progress updates, lab results, status changes.

🧭 Breadcrumb Navigation + Micro-interactions
For smoother navigation and real usability (loading states, transitions, instant feedback).

🔒 Admin Panel
Admin can access all patients, doctors, cases, and system activity.

What Makes This Project Stand Out

Built with real system thinking — not a basic CRUD.

Data flows through the entire app just like in medical software.

Uses design patterns: components, routing, protected routes, reusable UI system.

Strong focus on UX and micro-interactions (skeleton loaders, status updates, instant UI feedback).
